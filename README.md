## Chloe and her dogs

Welcome to this webpage, where you can see me and my dogs, whom I miss dearly as they are at their home in Arizona.

### Corky the Yorkie

This is Corky. We rescued him when he was 5 years old. He is now 11 and still thriving, as pictured below. Maybe he was born with it...

### Ellie

Ellie loves to hike. This is her gazing at the sunrise.

She and Corky are also great friends. Here they are hanging with thier fresh new 'dos.

### Alexa

The latest addition to the clan is Alexa. My mom rescued her in the fall of 2016. She was a reservation dog but now she is also a model.
