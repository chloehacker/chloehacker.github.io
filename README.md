## Chloe and her dogs

Welcome to this webpage, where you can see me and my dogs, whom I miss dearly as they are at their home in Arizona.

### Corky the Yorkie

This is Corky. We rescued him when he was 5 years old. He is now 11 and still thriving, as pictured below.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/chloehacker/chloehacker.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
